Optimizing Universal Language Models for Domain-Specific Text Classification
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a fast and flexible language modeling system to optimize universal language models for domain-specific text classification. It utilizes a Transformer-enhanced ULMFIT model, designed to achieve reliable results with minimal training and data effort. The system incorporates the BERT Transformer model to effectively capture deep contextual relationships in text using self-attention mechanisms. The methodology includes advanced fine-tuning techniques and data augmentation strategies to ensure high accuracy and adaptability across various domains.





Features

Transformer-enhanced ULMFIT Model: Employs a ULMFIT model enhanced with Transformer architecture for robust language understanding and generation.


BERT Integration: Utilizes the BERT Transformer model to capture deep contextual relationships in text.



Efficient Fine-Tuning: Implements Discriminative Fine-Tuning, Gradual Unfreezing, and a Slanted Triangular Learning Rate schedule for efficient, layer-wise optimization. These methods allow fast adaptation while maintaining the integrity of learned representations.



Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, stop-word removal, and tokenization, followed by masked language modeling on a domain-specific corpus to maximize contextual understanding.


Data Augmentation: Incorporates Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) and Back Translation to enhance generalization and model robustness.


Multi-Domain Training: Trained and evaluated on diverse datasets including IMDb, Yelp, and AG News, ensuring broad applicability.



Text Classification and Generation: Capable of both text classification and generation tasks, supporting context-aware, real-time predictions.
